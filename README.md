# Drafiro Places 

System folder icons from [Zafiro Icons](https://github.com/zayronxio/Zafiro-icons) but themed for [Dracula Dark theme for GTK](https://draculatheme.com/gtk). Three flavours:
* Pink
* Violet
* Violet-Pink gradient

### Swapping the icons

   - Replace the contents of the folder `~/.local/share/icons/Zafiro-Icons-Dark/places` with chosen flavour (depending on your installation method path may be different e.g. `~/.icons/Zafiro-Icons-Dark/places`)
   - Reset icons settings in GNOME Tweaks
